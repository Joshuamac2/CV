### Skills
-----------
##### Team-player and communication  

- I value collaboration and excel in a team environment, and I am excited about the prospect of delivering projects as a strong working unit. To these qualities, I also bring a fierce determination to succeed, combined with a high level of discipline, which I have acquired from my background in high-achieving sport.

##### Problem solver  

- By nature, I am a keen problem-solver. I have an inquisitive and scientific mindset and I am driven to identify and implement solutions in agile environments. As such, I am organised in my thought processes and I think strategically, but also arriving at results through imagination and an ability to conceptualise, reaching for ideas against which the data could be tested.



##### Fast learner  

- I thrive in environments that empower me to test new ways of learning and experiment with new skills and knowledge. My scientific background has not only strengthened my ability to retain large amounts of information but also apply that knowledge critically and effectively, under great pressure and at pace.
